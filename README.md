# PacMen-Exercise


<h1>Project description</h1>



The project deals with few very interesting problems such as edge detection and changing direction of “Pac Man” accordingly. Changing the picture as per the direction can also be problematic. 

<h1>Installation.</h1>

Download the whole git as a zip file. And double click on index.html to run the program. 

<h1>Future improvement </h1>

Add a button to create more “Pac man” and move them with different speeds in different directions.

# PacMen-Exercise


<h2>Project description</h2>



In the project, I built a “Pac Man” which will travel from one side of the screen to the other. It deals with few very interesting problems such as edge detection and changing direction of “Pac Man” accordingly. Changing the picture as per the direction can also be problematic. 

<h2>Installation.</h2>

Download the whole git as a zip file. And double click on index.html to run the program. One can clone the repository as will if some one wants to start adding new features to the project.  

<h2>Future improvement </h2>

Add a button to create more “Pac man” and move them with different speeds in different directions.
